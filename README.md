Write down the results of your Skat game and it automatically calculates scoring, ranking and tells you who's next to deal, respond and bid.

So the idea is to provide a nice tool to belovers of the famous German Skat game to relieve them of calculating and always finding the answer to the difficult question who is in duty of dealing, responding or bidding. A question which usually becomes harder to answer which each round played and number of beers consumed (although 'real' Skat players will feel embaressed by such unsacred style of playing).

I'm using this project as an experimental playing field to get accustomed with modern technology features and coding.
